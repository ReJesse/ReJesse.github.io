  <li><p style="text-align:left;"><b>Department of Information Engineer, CUHK</b><span style="float:right;">Sep 2020 - Jun 2021</span></p></li>
  <ul><li>Researched on scalability of a Graph Neural Network on financial data analytics.</li></ul>
  <ul><li>Implemented a pipeline with PyTorch and DGL for to detect anomaly users/activities. The framework reduced training time by 10-20% and gave close results on real-world business datasets. </li></ul>
  <ul><li>Cooperated with a team of 6 and designed a web-based user portal for graph analysis, which integrated node classification and link prediction objectives using transfer learning and active learning techniques.</li></ul>
  <p></p>

  <li><p style="text-align:left;"><b>Department of Computer Science, CUHK</b><span style="float:right;">May 2019 - Sep 2019</span></p></li>
  <ul><li>Conducted hotspot detection on layout patterns with several machine learning-based models</li></ul>
  <ul><li>Designed robust loss evaluation methods to deal with outlier data points.</li></ul>
  <ul><li>Implemented a generative neural network that boosted valid VLSI pattern number by 5.8% and pattern library diversity by 21.4%. The framework also enabled context-specific pattern generation with paper accepted.</li></ul>
